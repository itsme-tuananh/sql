<p>Even though you often will filter with conditions that include a column value that's being compared to a "hard-coded"&nbsp;value (e.g. <code>WHERE&nbsp;salary &gt;&nbsp;10000</code>), you can also define conditions where you compare columns with each other:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">SELECT *&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;employees WHERE&nbsp;salary &gt;&nbsp;expected_salary;</pre><p>You will also find<strong> more examples </strong>for (more complex) SELECT statements and WHERE&nbsp;clauses later in the course - especially also in the <strong>"Summary &amp;&nbsp;Practice"&nbsp;course section</strong>!</p>

<p>In the previous lecture, we added auto-incrementing IDs and the <code>PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY</code> constraint to <code>id</code> columns in the three main tables.</p><p>With that set up, you could insert data into these tables like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;employers (company_name, company_address, yearly_revenue, is_hiring)
VALUES ('Some Company Inc', 'Some Street 5, Mycity', 85.91, TRUE);</pre><p>Please note that <strong>no value</strong> is provided for the <code>id</code> column - because it's <strong>populated automatically</strong>.</p><p>If you fetch the data for this table (via <code>SELECT&nbsp;*&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;employers;</code>), you can see that a value (<code>1</code>) has been inserted automatically for the <code>id</code> column.</p><p>If you add another row (via <code>INSERT&nbsp;INTO</code> again) and you then fetch all the data again, you see that the first row still has an <code>id</code> of <code>1</code> but the second row has an <code>id</code> of <code>2</code> - which was also inserted automatically.</p><p>These unique IDs (which are guaranteed to be unique, thanks to <code>PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY</code>) can also be used to establish relations between different rows in different tables - though that is a topic we'll dive in in great detail later in the course!</p><p>Here's just a quick first example:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;users (full_name, yearly_salary, current_status)
VALUES ('Frank Meyer', 30000,&nbsp;'self-employed');</pre><p>This would create a new user which receives an <code>id</code> automatically. If it's the first user after table creation, the <code>id</code> will be <code>1</code>.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;conversations (user_id, employer_id, message)
VALUES (1, 2, 'Hi there!');</pre><p>The above command would add a new row into the <code>conversations</code> table - storing the user <code>id</code> <code>1</code> <em>(i.e. Frank&nbsp;Meyer's id)</em> and the employer <code>id</code> <code>2</code> <em>(the second employer you might've added)</em>.</p><p><strong>As mentioned, we'll explore relations and how to query and connect related data in greater detail later!</strong></p><p>For the moment, it's just important to keep this concept of auto-incrementing IDs and primary keys in mind.</p>

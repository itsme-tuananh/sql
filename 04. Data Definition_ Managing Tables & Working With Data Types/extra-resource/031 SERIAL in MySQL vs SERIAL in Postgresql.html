<p>As mentioned at the end of the previous lecture, you can use <code>SERIAL</code> to define an auto-incrementing number in both MySQL and Postgresql (and other)&nbsp;database systems.</p><p>However, besides <code>INT&nbsp;AUTO_INCREMENT</code> being more popular /&nbsp;used more often in the MySQL world, there also is another important note you should take:&nbsp;<code>SERIAL</code>&nbsp;will produce an <code>INT</code>&nbsp;value in Postgresql (and many other database systems) - but it will give you a <code>BIGINT</code> when used in MySQL.</p><p>This is something you should keep in mind if you go for <code>SERIAL</code>&nbsp;instead of <code>INT&nbsp;AUTO_INCREMENT</code> - especially when exploring relationships between records (which we'll do later in the course).</p>

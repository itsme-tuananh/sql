<p>When working with data types that include a time (like <code>TIMESTAMP</code>), the time of course is meaningless unless it's also combined with information about the <strong>timezone</strong> to which it belongs.</p><p>Many SQL&nbsp;database systems, including MySQL&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Postgresql, <strong>store times in UTC</strong> (i.e. using the UTC&nbsp;timezone)&nbsp;internally. Those database systems then <strong>automatically "translate" the time</strong> you provide or request from /&nbsp;to your local timezone.</p><p>So if you insert a time like <code>16:32:00</code> and you're located in CEST&nbsp;(Central European Summer Time), then a value of <code>14:32:00</code> would be stored internally, as this is the UTC&nbsp;equivalent.</p><p>If data is then fetched via <code>SELECT</code>, the time is returned in CEST&nbsp;again. Or, if it's requested from a client located in another timezone, it's returned translated to that timezone's time.</p>

<h4>Introducing <code>NULL</code></h4><p>In the previous lecture, you learned about the special <code>NULL</code>&nbsp;value - which simply means that a record has no data for a specific column.</p><p>As mentioned, <code>NULL</code>&nbsp;is not the same as <code>0</code> or <code>0.0</code> for numeric columns or <code>''</code>&nbsp;(i.e. an empty string, empty text) for text columns. The latter examples (<code>0</code>, <code>0.0</code>, <code>''</code>) are examples for values that are available - there is no missing data here. <code>0</code> is a valid number after all.</p><h4>How can you insert NULL&nbsp;as a value?</h4><p>You simply insert it by omitting a column (and its value) in the <code>INSERT&nbsp;INTO</code> statement.</p><p>Here's an example:</p><p>Assume that you have a table that was created like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">CREATE&nbsp;TABLE example (
  full_name VARCHAR(200),
  salary INT
);</pre><p>Data could be inserted like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">INSERT&nbsp;INTO example (full_name, salary)
VALUES&nbsp;('Max Schwarz', 19000);</pre><p>In this case, no <code>NULL</code>&nbsp;data would end up in the inserted row as values are provided for all columns.</p><p>Here's the same example without a salary:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">INSERT&nbsp;INTO example (full_name)
VALUES&nbsp;('Max Schwarz');</pre><p>Only the <code>full_name</code> column is referenced (and receives a value). <code>salary</code> is omitted - both in the column as well as in the <code>VALUES</code>&nbsp;list. In this case, no data would be written into the <code>salary</code> column for this inserted row - i.e. <code>NULL</code> would be the assumed value for <code>salary</code> for this record.</p><p>If you would perform an operation like the below one, the <code>NULL</code>&nbsp;value would be ignored and would therefore not distort the overall result:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">SELECT&nbsp;AVG(salary)&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;example; -- The average would be calculated without taking the NULL values into account (i.e. NULL&nbsp;is NOT treated as 0!)</pre><h4><code>NULL</code>&nbsp;and <code>DEFAULT</code> Values</h4><p>If you have a table definition where some (or all) columns have default values (defined via <code>DEFAULT</code>), those columns can never store <code>NULL</code> as a value - even if no specific data is provided in the <code>INSERT&nbsp;INTO</code>&nbsp;statement. The reason for that is, that the <code>DEFAULT</code> value will be used if no specific data is provided. </p>

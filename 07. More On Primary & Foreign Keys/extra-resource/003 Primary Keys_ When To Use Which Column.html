<p>You learned that most tables should have a <code>PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY</code>&nbsp;and that often, an auto-incrementing ID will be used as a primary key. But you also learned that this is <strong>not a must-do</strong> - you <strong>can use any column as a primary key</strong>!</p><p>But when should you use which column?&nbsp;When should you use a user's email as a primary key, instead of an "artificially added"&nbsp;id column?</p><p>There are couple of thoughts I&nbsp;want to share about this important question:</p><ul><li><p>You <strong>can always use an auto-incrementing id column </strong>if you want to or if you didn't find a better&nbsp;"real identification criteria"&nbsp;for a given table and its records</p></li><li><p>You could consider using another column (e.g. an email)&nbsp;if that is the "<strong>real identification criteria</strong>"&nbsp;of the table's records <em>(for example, you could argue that users are indeed uniquely identified via their email addresses - hence you could use the email column as a </em><code><em>PRIMARY&nbsp;KEY</em></code><em>&nbsp;column)</em></p></li><li><p>You might <strong>still want to add and use an "artificial primary key"</strong> (a so-called surrogate key) for various reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Maybe despite being identified uniquely via email addresses, you want to also have unique IDs for users (e.g. so that you have a simpler and shorter unique value per user)</p></li><li><p>Some potential "real keys"&nbsp;<strong>might take up lots of memory </strong>and could therefore even <strong>slow down queries </strong>=&gt;&nbsp;Auto-incrementing ids might be more efficient to use for frequent queries (especially when also working with lots of complex relationships)</p></li><li><p>Some columns <strong>might look unique at first </strong>- but aren't if you think about them again <em>(e.g. the "street"&nbsp;of an address might be unique - but only per city;&nbsp;the same street could be part of multiple cities or even countries)</em></p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Ultimately, it will always come down to a variety of factors:&nbsp;The exact use-case you have, experience, personal preferences etc. You should be open to look for "real keys"&nbsp;instead of always automatically using auto-incrementing IDs but you probably also shouldn't force it.</p>

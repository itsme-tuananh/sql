<p>In this course, we'll use VS&nbsp;Code with the SQLTools extension for interacting with the database, since this allows us to use a uniform interface and save queries into (re-executable) text files (<code>.sql</code> files) with ease.</p><p>Of course, you could use any other client (e.g. the clients shown earlier in this section)&nbsp;as well.</p><p>If you are using VS&nbsp;Code with SQLTools, we strongly recommend that you do<strong> explore the VS&nbsp;Code settings for this extension</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Open the "<strong><em>User Settings</em></strong>"&nbsp;(global settings)&nbsp;or "<strong><em>Workspace Settings</em></strong>"&nbsp;(project-specific settings) in VS&nbsp;Code (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">More Details</a>)</p></li><li><p>Search for "<strong><em>SQLTools</em></strong>"</p></li><li><p>Browse the SQLTools settings and adjust them to best fit your needs</p></li></ol><p>There's one specific setting that you might want to turn off:&nbsp;"<strong>Auto Open Session&nbsp;Files</strong>". If that's turned on, a new <code>.sql</code> file will be opened automatically, every time you switch the database connection. As this can become annoying, you might want to disable this behavior with the mentioned setting.</p>
